The Real-World Evidence group at the University Medical Center Utrecht enables robust evidence on the usage and potential benefits or risks of a medical product derived from analysis of Real-World data generated during health care delivery. 

We implement and continuously develop and improve methods for a data transformation pipeline that can be applied to multiple common data models (FHIR, ConcePTION, OMOP) to generate RWE. We also develop RWD quality checks to assess whether RWD are complete, logical and fit for purpose. 

The RWE group performs European wide and global studies and is a partner in the SIGMA consortium, the VAC4EU network, the European Pharmacoepidemiology & Pharmacovigilance research network. The group coordinates multiple large-scale projects (IMI-ConcePTION) and projects for the European Medicines Agency (ACCESS, Early Covid-Vaccine Monitor, Covid Vaccine Monitor, CONSIGN: medicines effects in pregnant women with COVID)

The RWE Github organization comprises the scripts and functions that are used in various projects, which are version controlled, transparent and re-usable using the Git functionality.
